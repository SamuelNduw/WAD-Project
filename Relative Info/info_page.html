            <h2>Introduction to Common Illnesses</h2>
            <p>Diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and cholera continue to pose major health challenges in
                Africa. Malaria, for instance, remains endemic in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, contributing
                significantly to illness and mortality. These diseases affect different regions based on factors like
                climate, healthcare access, and socioeconomic conditions, with many populations in rural areas
                experiencing greater vulnerabilities due to limited medical resources. Additionally, zoonotic
                diseases—those transmitted from animals to humans, such as Ebola—have seen an uptick in recent years,
                partially influenced by climate change and human encroachment on wildlife habitats.</p>

        <section id="symptoms">
            <h2>Symptoms of Common Diseases in Africa</h2>
            <p>Identifying early symptoms of major diseases can be lifesaving. For malaria, symptoms like fever, chills,
                headache, and fatigue often appear within weeks of a mosquito bite. Tuberculosis usually starts with a
                persistent cough, fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. HIV/AIDS may initially present as flu-like
                symptoms but can progress to more severe signs like recurrent infections, prolonged fever, and
                significant weight loss if untreated. Recognizing these symptoms early and seeking timely medical help
                can reduce complications and prevent spread.</p>

        <section id="diseases">
            <h2>Common Diseases in Africa</h2>
            <p>Africa’s disease profile is characterized by both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Infectious
                diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria remain prevalent and require extensive public
                health interventions to manage. Recently, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes and
                cardiovascular diseases have also increased, partly due to lifestyle changes. The WHO's vaccination
                programs and efforts to increase healthcare accessibility are making progress, especially with new
                initiatives like the rollout of the R21 malaria vaccine in high-risk areas.</p>

        <section id="health-rights">
            <h2>Health Care Rights and Resources</h2>
            <p>Everyone has the right to healthcare, a principle upheld by the World Health Organization and African
                Union. Health initiatives in Africa focus on ensuring equitable access to treatment, preventive
                measures, and health education. Local and international organizations, including WHO and Red Cross,
                provide information and resources to empower communities, particularly in under-resourced regions.
                Learning about one’s healthcare rights can be a powerful tool for advocacy and personal health
                management.</p>

        <section id="prevention">
            <h2>Prevention Tips</h2>
            <p>Prevention is crucial for controlling disease spread in Africa. For diseases like malaria, mosquito nets
                and insect repellents provide primary defenses against bites. Tuberculosis prevention focuses on
                avoiding close contact with infected individuals and improving ventilation in crowded spaces. Cholera,
                exacerbated by poor sanitation, can be mitigated with access to clean water, improved sanitation, and
                personal hygiene practices. WHO emphasizes vaccination, health education, and cross-border surveillance
                as effective strategies to curb outbreaks.</p>
